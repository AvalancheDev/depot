Welcome to DEPOT Documentation, DEPOT is an framework
for easily store files in web applications.

Modern web applications need to rely on a huge amount of
stored images, generated files and other data which is usually
best to keep outside of your database. DEPOT provides a
simple and effective interface for storing your files on
a storage backend at your choice (**Local**, **S3**, **GridFS**)
and easily relate them to your application models (**SQLAlchemy**, **Ming**)
like you would for plain data.
